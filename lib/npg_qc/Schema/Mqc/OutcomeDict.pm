=head1 NAME

  npg_qc::Schema::Mqc::OutcomeDict

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package OutcomeDict;
  with 'npg_qc::Schema::Mqc::OutcomeDict';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  Common functionality for lane and library manual qc outcome dictionary DBIx objects.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 is_final_outcome_description

  Argument - short qc outcome description.
  Returns true if the argument describes a final outcome, false otherwise.
  Can be used as both class and instance method.

  __PACKAGE__->is_final_outcome_description('Accepted final'); # returns true
  $row->is_final_outcome_description('Accepted preliminary'); # returns false

=head2 is_final_outcome

  Utility method to check if the outcome is considered final.

=head2 is_accepted

  Utility method which checks the short description to decide if the outcome can
  be considered accepted.

=head2 is_rejected

  Utility method which checks the short description to decide if the outcome can
  be considered rejected.

=head2 is_final_accepted

  Utility method which checks the short description to decide if the outcome can
  be considered final and accepted.

=head2 is_undecided

  Utility method which checks the short description to decide if the outcome can
  be considered as undecided.

=head2 pk_value

  Returns the value of primary key for the object if the table was defined with
  a single column primary key. Croaks if there is no primary key column or if
  there is a multi column primary key.

=head2 matching_final_short_desc

  If this outcome is final, returns a short description of this outcome,
  otherwise returns a short description for a matching final outcome.
  The returned outcome description does not necessarily exist in a
  dictionary.
  
    print $dict_row->short_desc; # Rejected preliminary
    print $dict_row->matching_final_short_desc(); # Rejected final

    print $dict_row->short_desc; # Rejected final
    print $dict_row->matching_final_short_desc(); # Rejected final

=head2 generate_short_description

  Package-level method for generating descriptions matching short
  descriptions in the dictionary tables.

   my $is_final = 1;
   my $is_accepted = 1;
  __PACKAGE__->generate_short_description($is_final, $is_accepted);
  # returns 'Accepted final'
    __PACKAGE__->generate_short_description($is_final);
  # returns 'Undecided final'
