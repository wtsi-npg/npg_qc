=head1 NAME

npg_qc::autoqc::results::rna_seqc

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A class for wrapping some of the metrics generated by RNA-SeQC.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 rrna

rRNA reads are non-duplicate and duplicate reads aligning to rRNA
regions as defined in the transcript model definition.

=cut

=head2 rrna_rate

Rate of rRNA per total reads.

=cut

=head2 exonic_rate

Fraction mapping within exons.

=cut

=head2 expression_profiling_efficiency

Ratio of exon reads to total reads.

=cut

=head2 genes_detected

Number of Genes with at least 5 reads.

=cut

=head2 end_1_sense

Number of End 1 reads that were sequenced in the sense direction.

=cut

=head2 end_1_antisense

Number of End 1 reads that were sequenced in the antisense direction.

=cut

=head2 end_2_sense

Number of End 1 reads that were sequenced in the sense direction.

=cut

=head2 end_2_antisense

Number of End 2 reads that were sequenced in the antisense direction.

=cut

=head2 end_1_pct_sense

Percentage of intragenic End 1 reads that were sequenced in the sense
direction.

=cut

=head2 end_2_pct_sense

Percentage of intragenic End 2 reads that were sequenced in the sense
direction.

=cut

=head2 mean_per_base_cov

Mean Per Base Coverage of the middle 1000 expressed transcripts
determined to have the highest expression levels.

=cut

=head2 mean_cv

Mean Coverage of the middle 1000 expressed transcripts determined to
have the highest expression levels.

=cut

=head2 end_5_norm

Norm denotes that the end coverage is divided by the mean coverage
for that transcript.

=cut

=head2 end_3_norm

Norm denotes that the end coverage is divided by the mean coverage
for that transcript.

=cut

=head2 end_5_norm

All remaining RNA-SeQC metrics as a key-values pairs
