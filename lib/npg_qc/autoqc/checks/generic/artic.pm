npg_qc::autoqc::checks::generic::artic

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Examples of invocation via a qc script:
  
  qc --check generic --spec artic --rpt_list 34761:1 \
     --input_files qc_summary.tsv --qc_out dir \
     --tm_json_file file --pp_name covid --pp_version 33

  # When an attribute is a glob, quote the attribute's value to
  # prevent an early glob expansion. The glob expression for the
  # sample_qc_out attribute should contain the '/plex*/' part.
  qc --check generic --spec artuc --rpt_list 34761:1 \
     --tm_json_file file \
     --input_files_glob '/plexes*/pipeline/qc_summary.tsv' \
     --sample_qc_out 'dir2/plex*/qc'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is a factory for creating npg_qc::autoqc::results::generic
type objects for the output of the
L<ncov2019-artic-nf|https://github.com/wtsi-team112/ncov2019-artic-nf>
pipeline. It captures the QC summary, which is produced by this pipeline.

Ideally, this check should run per lane and should be given
input_file_glob for it to locate input data and qc_out_summary
directory glob to fan out result JSON files, one per directory. If the
check is run in this manner, it is able to add information about
negative controls to results for real samples and positive controls.

Setting the input_files array attribute is an alternative way of
providing input, in this case the value of the input_file_glob
attribute is ignored.

If the qc_out_summary attribute is not set and the qc_out attribute
is set, all output will go to the latter directory.

The tm_json_file attribute gives a path to the tag metrics autoqc
result JSON file, which provides information about the content of the
pool and the number of reads in the input to the ncov2019-artic-nf
pipeline. The ncov2019-artic-nf might not produce the QC summary for
every sample of the pool, this might be due to low or zero number of input
reads. Information in the tag metrics is used to fill the gaps so that
the check produces a result object for each sample of the pool. This
is also true if, at run time, the glob is resolved to an empty list of
files.

Autoqc results for tag zero and a spiked-in control are not created by this
check since the downstream code assumes that all generic artic autoqc results
belong to the target project (see script L<npg_mqc_skipper> and class
L<npg_qc::mqc::skipper> in this git package).

This class is a re-implementation, the original implementation was
available in the bin/npg_autoqc_generic4artic script of the same
git package.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=cut

=head2 tm_json_file

A path to a JSON file serialization of the tag_metrics autoqc
result object for teh same lane and run this object belongs to.
A required attribute, should resolve to an existing readable
file at run time.

=cut

has 'tm_json_file' => (
  isa      => 'NpgTrackingReadableFile',
  is       => 'ro',
  required => 1,
);

=head2 input_files_glob

An optional attribute to set a glob expression for check input files,
QC summary outputs of the ncov2019-artic-nf pipeline.

=cut

has 'input_files_glob' => (
  isa       => 'Str',
  is        => 'ro',
  predicate => '_has_input_files_glob',
  required  => 0,
);

=head2 input_files

Array reference with paths of input files for this check. An optional
lazily built attribute inherited from npg_qc::autoqc::checks::check,
the method for building it is overwritten here to search for input
files using a glob expression in the input_files_glob attribute. 

=cut

has '+input_files' => (
  isa       => 'ArrayRef[NpgTrackingReadableFile]',
);
sub _build_input_files {
  my $self = shift;

  $self->_has_input_files_glob or croak 'input_files_glob should be defined';
  ($self->input_files_glob eq q[]) and croak
    'input_files_glob value cannot be an empty string';
  my @files = glob $self->input_files_glob;
  # Retrieving no files is not an error!
  carp sprintf '%s file%s found using glob %s',
    (@files ? scalar @files : 'No'),
    (@files == 1 ? ' was' : 's were'), $self->input_files_glob;
  return \@files;
}

=head2 result

This lazily built attribute is inherited from the parent and is changed
to be an array of npg_qc::autoqc::results::generic result objects. A result
object is created for each tag index in a pool (lane), apart from tag zero
and a tag for a spiked-in control. The result objects, that have a
corresponding input file, have the ncov2019-artic-nf QC summary, other result
objects do not have this information.

The array is sorted by tag index in ascending order.

=cut

  isa       => 'ArrayRef[npg_qc::autoqc::results::generic]',
