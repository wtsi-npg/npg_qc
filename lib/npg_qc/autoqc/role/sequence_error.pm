=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 check_name - human readable check name

=head2 subset - returns the value of the sequence_type attribute

=head2 forward_average_percent_error - forware average percentage of error across all cycle

=head2 reverse_average_percent_error - reverse average percentage of error across all cycles

=head2 criterion

=head2 reference_for_title - Trimmed version of the reference so it can be 
used in a view. Returns a hash reference with keys for species and version.
