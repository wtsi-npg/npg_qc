 - add links from upstream tags "Tags in upstream runs" section to tag metrics results for upstream runs

release 18.4
 - make daemon definition work on hosts where the code is deployed
   differently; relies on CATALYST_HOME env variable being set up

release 18.3
 - upstream tags: correct divide by zero error

release 18.2
 - add utility function in model for upstream tags to sort unexpected tag results into perfect_match_count order (desc)

release 18.1
 - add filter for upstreeam tags checks results (high-scoring tags, perfect matches >= .01%)

release 18.0

   and npg cpan lib location through PERL5LIB;
   hardcoded Catalyst-specific cpan dependencies for lenny

release 17.4
 - update live URL for getting/posting lims data as requested in RT#336085

release 17.3
 - updated links to NPG QC to point to a url relative to NPG tracking url

release 17.2
 - added display for upstream_tags check

release 17.1
 - use html-specific XML validation in tests to avoid spurious errors

 - enable manual qc widget if run status is 'qc on hold' RT#348314

release 17.0
 - the app's sceleton updated by running the latest catalist.pl sctipt
 - Build.PL script capable of installing dependencies added
 - list of dependencies udated
 - demon definition moved inside the main application

release 16.7

   id_run, resulting in already qc_complete run moved back to archival_pending;
   fix: do not cache run_id in the model (DBIC schema) attribute

release 16.6
 - upgraded (including the daemon) to run under perl 5.14.2 with the latest Catalyst

     the problem goes if the response from psd server is not compressed
     this might be a bug in the Unicode::Encoding plugin we are using to display correctly utf8 encoded strings
     the current solution is a hack - the ajax proxy removes teh 'Accept-Encoding' for a request that goes to psd

release 15.3
 - warehouse query for sample id in the genotype template uses Cyrrent Sample table instead of Sample table
 - test data updated following renaming of DBIx classes for npg-qc database

release 15.2
 - revert back change done in 15.1 since xml files coming from ajax proxy are encoded incorrectly - browser cannot parse them

 - text link representing the run id points to the NPG run page,

Links within the SeqQC pages are shown as blue arrows
 - beside a pool name is an arrow forking down to take you to a view of the plexes.  This replaces the small 'p' beside the lane number.

 - beside a library name is an arrow taking you 'Up' to the sample page

 - the focus icon (4 outward arrows) to the left of the pool/library name takes you to the page of all lanes/plexes of this library

New  ï¿½ icon on the headers for lane results and an individual result:
 - collapse/expand relevant part of the page.
