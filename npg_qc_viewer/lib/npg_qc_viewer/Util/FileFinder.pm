=head1 NAME

npg_qc_viewer::Util::FileFinder

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Finds files if file-extension type corresponding to this objects' attributes.
Files can be stored either in a database or on a file system or both.
If the database connection is available (qc_schema attribute is set), the database search
is performed first; id_run should be set for this. If the database search brings no results,
a file system glob is performed.

If the file extension differs from default, the database search is not performed.

One of run folder paths can be supplied in the constructor to assist with defining the
archival path for the run folder. Both run and all lane archives are going to be searched
at once.

Location attribute can be supplied to force a search in a number of known file system locations.
In this case the value of the id_run attribute is disregarded.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 db_lookup - boolean flag showing whether the file names come from the database

=head2 BUILD - Sets db_lookup to 0 in case a non-default extension is used.

=head2 file_extension - an attribute, defaults to fastqcheck

=head2 qc_schema - DBIx schema object for the NPG QC database, optional

=head2 location - an optional array ref of paths for looking up files

=head2 files - lazily built hash ref containing all actually available file names
as keys and, in case of successful file system search, file paths as values
