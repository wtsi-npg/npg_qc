 <h3>Genotype check</h3>

<br/>

<h4>Description</h4>
This check uses samtools to call genotypes for a set of loci. These loci correspond to SNPs assayed on the standard Sequenom plex used to provide a "fingerprint" of samples before they are sent for sequencing.
<br/><br/>


<h4>Summary Area</h4>
This displays the number of calls matched out of the number of loci called in both the Sequenom assay and from the BAM file from sequencing. If any of the coverage depths for the BAM genotype is at or below the threshold of 5, a ~ is displayed before this information, otherwise an = is displayed. The second line displays indicates how good the depth of coverage for the BAM genotypes. If there were alternative samples with a good match, 'alts' will be displayed here, preceded by a '~' if they are loose matches to low depth genotypes (see below for an explanation of strict and loose matches).
<br/>
There is a tooltip for the match value which reports a "Match score". This is computed by assigning subscore of 1 to exact matches, 0 to weaker matches (hom BAM call against het Sequenom call) and -1 to serious mismatches (either a het BAM call against a hom Sequenom call, or a mismatch between hom calls), then summing all the subscores. The ratio of this score to the number of common calls is also displayed - this will range from -1 (complete mismatch) to 1 (perfect match).
<br/><br/>


<h4>Strict and loose matches</h4>
Strict matches are a straight-forward comparison of the calls - if they are identical (apart from allele order) it's a match, otherwise a mismatch.
<br/>
Loose matches are an attempt to compensate for the fact that at low depths of coverage, the chances of seeing both alleles in a heterozygous sample are reduced. So if a homozygous call is made from the BAM file at low depth (&le; 5), it is allowed to match a heterozygous Sequenom call.
<br/><br/>

The results displayed for calls, depths and likelihoods follow this order (SNP name alphabetically sorted).
<br/><br/>

<h4>Likelihoods</h4>
Each item in the "Likelihoods" row is a list of numbers indicating the likelihood of the possible calls. From the <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/mpileup.shtml">samtools mpileup documentation</a>, under "SAMtools/BCFtools specific information": <em>"SAMtools/BCFtools writes genotype likelihoods in the PL format which is a [...] list of phred-scaled data likelihoods of each possible genotype. For example, suppose REF=C and ALT=A,G, PL=7,0,37,13,40,49 means for the sample we are looking at, P(D|CC)=10^{-0.7}, P(D|CA)=1, P(D|AA)=10^{-3.7}, P(D|CG)=10^{-1.3}, P(D|AG)=1e-4 and P(D|GG)=10^{-4.9}. "</em>
<br/>
Because all of the SNPs we are using are biallelic, we just have three possible (non-NN) values for a call - RefRef, RefAlt, or AltAlt - so all likelihoods should be 3 numbers except when homozygous reference is called, when you'll just see "0". 
<br/>
Note: Bcftools has a tendency to favour the reference allele when calling genotypes. This is particularly noticeable at low depths of coverage - you may see a heterozygous call at a locus which has only one supporting read for the non-reference allele.

<br/><br/>
<h4>Sequenom calls</h4>
This row shows the results of the Sequenom assay on this sample to allow easy comparison with the genotypes called from the BAM file produced by sequencing. For each call a tooltip is available which reports the SNP rsname and ref/alt alleles. This is to allow easier interpretation of the likelihood values, where you need to know which allele is reference and alternate.
<br/><br/>

<h4>BAM calls</h4>
This row shows the genotype called from the BAM file produced by sequencing. Call are colour-coded:
<br/>
<table summary="BAM genotype" cellspacing="30">
<tr><th>Colour</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Comment</th></tr>
<tr><td class="gtcall_match">blue</td><td>close match</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td class="gtcall_severe_mismatch">red</td><td>serious mismatch</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td class="gtcall_unrecognised_code">black</td><td>mild mismatch or unknown</td><td>italics indicate mismatch, no italics indicate no information<br/>&nbsp;probably sue to no sample match found</td></tr>
</table>
<br/>

<h4>Call depths</h4>
The number of reads supporting the call. Low depth (&le;5) is indicated with italics.
<br/><br/>

<h4>Closest alternative match</h4>
Any close genotype matches found under a different sample name.
<br/><br/>

<h4>Loose alternative match</h4>
Any close genotype matches found under a different sample name, allowing homozygous calls at low depth from BAM to match heterozygous Sequenom calls (e.g. AA(BAM) == AT(Sqnm))

 <h3>RNA-SeQC metrics</h3>
 <h4>Description</h4>
 <p>Subset of metrics obtained from Broad Institute's RNA-SeQC package. The following summary statistics are calculated by counting the number of reads that have the given characteristics.</p>
 <br/>
 <h4>Mapped Reads</h4>
 <p><b>rRNA</b> reads are non-duplicate and duplicate reads aligning to rRNA regions as defined in the transcript model definition. <b>rRNA Rate</b> is per total reads. </p>
 <br/>
 <h4>Transcript-associated Reads</h4>
 <p>Rates are per mapped read. <b>Exonic Rate</b> is the fraction mapping within exons. <b>Expression Profile Efficiency</b> is the ratio of exon reads to total reads. <b>Transcripts/Genes Detected </b> is the number of transcripts/Genes with at least 5 reads. </p>
 <br/>
 <h4>Strand Specificity</h4>
 <p><b>End 1/2 Sense</b> are the number of End 1 or 2 reads that were sequenced in the sense direction. Similarly, <b>End 1/2 Antisense</b> are the number of End 1 or 2 reads that were sequenced in the antisense direction.<b>End 1/2 Sense %</b> are percentages of intragenic End 1/2 reads that were sequenced in the sense direction. </p>
 <br/>
 <h4>Coverage Metrics Highest 1000 Expressed Transcripts</h4>
 <p>The metrics in this table are calculated across the transcripts that were determined to have the highest expression levels. <b>5'</b> and <b>3'</b> values are per-base coverage averaged across all top transcripts.   5' and 3' ends are 200 base pairs.  Gap % is the total cumulative gap length divided by the total cumulative transcript lengths. </p>
 <br/>
<br/>

 <a name="tag metrics_check"></a>
 <h3>Tag metrics</h3>
 <h4>Description</h4>
 <p>This check displays statistics about decoding of the index read. The semantics of the summary table data differs for pools and individual libraries.</p>
 <p>For a pool the overall decoding percent is displayed, followed by the coefficient of variance that characterises the uniformity of tag distribution in a pool. The background of the table cell is blue if the overall decoding rate is over 80%, for lesser values the background is red.</p>
 <p>For an individual library (tag), the decoding percent for this library within a pool is displayed. If the number of reads for this tag is at least one tenth the average number of reads per tag for this pool, the background is grey; otherwise, the background is red.</p>
 <p>For dual-index runs the percentage number of tag hops is also displayed together with an estimate of the power to detect tag hops. The power is a number between 0 (a pool containing all possible tag combinations) and 1 (a pool containing only UDIs). It is possible for tag hops to be detected even if the power is 0, in this case tag hops correspond to reads where the second tag is missing and the second index read sequence matches what is expected on the spiked phix which only has one tag</p>
 <br/>
 <h4>Coefficient of variance calculation:</h4>
  <p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/~kgb/PDL-2.3.2/Basic/Primitive/primitive.pd#stats">mean</a> = &Sigma;(x<sub>i</sub>) &frasl; N<br/>

 <h3>Upstream Tags Check</h3>
 <h4>Description</h4>
Check for contamination of tag#0 BAM file by reads from upstream runs

<h3>VerifyBamID contamination check</h3>
<br/><br/>
<h4>Description</h4>
VerifyBamID provides metrics which can be informative in helping to 
determine whether a sample has possibly been subject to within-species 
DNA contamination from an unrelated individual.
<br/>

The method of operation used is the sequence-only method, which doesn't 
require or utilise previous genotype information for a sample and 
therefore attempts to detect possible sample mixture from population 
minor allele frequency information only. Currently this is only 
implemented for human samples, but this could be extended in future if 
relevant information was collected/available.

<br/><br/>
<h4>Output Fields</h4>
<br/>
<table style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 50%;">
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td># SNPs</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 0 5px 10px;">Number of SNPs passing the criteria to be used in the estimate 
from the input VCF file. Note smaller numbers of sites tend to result in 
less accurate estimates of contamination, particularly at lower levels 
of contamination.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>AVG_DP</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 0 5px 10px;">Average sequencing depth at the used sites in the VCF file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>FREEMIX</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 0 5px 10px;">Sequence-only estimate of contamination (0-1 scale). A FREEMIX 
score of 0.02, means 2% or more of non-reference bases are observed in 
reference sites. Note contamination estimates tend to be overestimated, 
particularly for estimates below 1%.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>FREELK1</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 0 5px 10px;">Maximum log-likelihood of the sequence reads given estimated 
contamination under sequence-only method.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>FREELK0</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 0 5px 10px;">Log-likelihood of the sequence reads given no contamination 
under sequence-only method.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br/><br/>
<h4>Interpretation Guidelines</h4>
As a guide when the allele-frequency based estimates of FREEMIX are 
greater than or equal to 0.03, FREELK1-FREELK0 is large, depth is 
reasonable (minimum of 2x, and ideally greater than 4x) and a 
significant number of sites (ideally greater than 10,000) has been 
included in the estimate, then further investigation into the 
possibility of contamination is recommended.
<br/>

Results will be coloured red where the estimates of FREEMIX are greater
than or equal to 0.05, average depth is greater than or equal to 2 and
the number of sites is greater than 10,000.
