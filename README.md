## NPG QC database

### Legacy Data

QC metrics and evaluation outcomes for all production Illumina sequencing runs
are stored in a relational database. This database has four legacy tables,
`recipe_file`, `run_and_pair`, `run_info`, `run_recipe`, for which we do not
generate ORM classes. No code is using these tables. The data is kept for
auditing perposes. The size of these tables is small in comparison with the size
of the rest of the tables. The overhead of moving these old tables to a different
storage is not justified.
